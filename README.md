### How to use 
The first row of buttons are tools, they are eraser, pen, triangle, circle, rectangle, from left to right. Click on them and do the magic on the canvas.

The second row of buttons are thickness/size bar and color picker. Both are options for painting tools and text inputs.

The third row is the text feature. First type in texts in the input bar, then choose font on the right and pick color and font size with the option in the second row. Last, click on the text icon and tap on where you want the text to be on the canvas, up comes the text!

The fourth row are undo, redo, and delete button which cleans up the entire canvas.

The last row are download and upload buttons. The former automatically download the image you've drawn and the latter opens up file selector to pick image to draw on the canvas.

### Function description

The original upload button stood out, but in a hedious way, so I changed it with the help of CSS and made it fit in the color scheme.
